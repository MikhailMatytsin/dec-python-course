## What we assume about you:

Python programming can be used for many topics in computer science.
It is impossible to cover all of them in one training.
Therefore, we make the following assumptions about you and your use case: 

1. You want to use Python for some kind of data work (numbers, text data, geo-data etc.) as opposed to developing software, a server back-end etc.

1. You have some experience working with data. For example, extensive work in Excel or some work in Stata or R.

1. You are familiar with the topic you want to apply your Python skills to

## Scope of this session

.pull-left[
The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
that you have any background in programming. 

If you have no background in any type of programming, 
then this session will prepare you for the rest of the course.

We will cover how working with code is different,
some basic concepts of programming
as well as allow a lot of time for questions.

# Why programming? Why Python?

---

## Why programming? 

.pull-left[
When working in programming we do not interact with the data directly.
Instead, we write code that are exact instructions for a computer to interact with the data.

Computers always follows our instructions exactly.
This give us an exact and transparent record 
of what was done to our data 
to generate the outputs that we publish.

Compare with Excel where outputs are created
using a mix of formulas and editing the data manually.

In Excel we share the final output but not how we got there. 
In programming we share the final output 
and we can include unambiguous instructions how to got there.

## Why Python?

Everything about programming on the previous slide
applies to all programming languages. 
Why are we teaching Python over any other language?

1. Python is popular - especially in data science 
Since we commonly copy other people's code, this actually matter a lot

2. Python is can be used for much more than statistics/data science.
Alternatives to Python like R and Stata can only be used for data

3. Pyhton is considered to have "easy syntax". 
This means that the code is written more similarly to regular English,
making it easier for a human to read and understand what the code does.
However, as beginners you will not always find it easy to read Python code,
but it is easier than any comparable alternative.

## Data work in Excel vs. programmaing

When working with code you need a different mindset and approach to datawork

.pull-left[
### Excel
* In Excel you edit the `.xlsx` file directly and save new version of the file.
* This file includes all input data, formulas, manual edits
as well the final outputs. 
* The final output can be a results of 
manual edits, formulas in cells, features from the menus in Excel 
or mix of them all
* When collaborating, you share the file 
and other team members makes edits directly to the file
* Apart from formulas in cells, 
there is no log of what anyone has done manually to the data
]

.pull-right[
### Programming
* In programming you only edit the code, 
and never directly the input data or the output
* Think of code as instructions for a computer on how to
generate outputs from a certain input, 
including all data cleaning steps.
* When collaborating, you share the code files,
and other team members only edit the instructions in the code
* The code should never require any manual steps - all steps needed should be included in the code
* Anyone with the code and the inputs should be able to genereate the same outputs, with no other action than running the code

## Programming is like writing recepies

.pull-left[
### Sponge cake:
* Set oven on 200C
* Melt 200g butter and mix with 200g sugar
* Mix in 4eggs one at the time
* Mix in 200g flour
* Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 min
]

.pull-right[
### Data science visualization:
* Get GDP per capita data from for all countries
* Get investment data from all WB client countries
* Remove data that was not found in both dataset
* Sort ascendingly on GDP per capita
* Export a scatter plot and format the colors and the text
]

Really, thinking of your code as a baking recipe is a great approach to write good code.

## The code is an output in itself

Many people new to programming only think of _code as a means to an end_.
Something that give them access to advanced topics like 
regression analysis, machine learning, national language processing etc.

While it is true that code enables you to do advanced things you should consider the **_code as a end in itself_**. Think of code as an output just as much as dashboards, data visualizations etc. are.

Think of **_code as a comprehensive and exact method of communicating_** 
about your work. 
Outputs shared, published etc. with the code used to generate them
will always be received as more credible.

Results in a research papers without a _theory_/_methods_ section
are often no considered credible results.
Similarly, data work not accompanied with code 
is often not considered credible datawork.


---

## Re-use code

Since the instructions in programming are files 
separate from inputs and outputs, 
we can easier copy instructions across different projects. 

Even if you were to have an exact log of all steps ever done to an Excel file,
it would likely involve a lot of work applying them all to a new file,
and it would be error prone.

Programmers always re-use code across projects.
It is an art to write fully re-usable code 
that require little or no work when re-used across projects.
But it will always be easier and less error prone
than manually copy work in Excel.

Some developers write code which only purpose is 
to be used by other users in their projects.
This is often developed as open-source code packages.
Such code packages are called a "_libraries_" and
there are 1000s of them free to use.
This means that for most purposes 
you do not need to write your code starting from scratch.
You can always build on someone else's efforts.

---

## Summary? 

This can be summed up in these key advantages about programming:

**1. Transparency**<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent log
of everything ever done to the input data.
This log can be shared with others,
but the person likely to benefit from this most frequently is yourself.

**2. Replication**<br>
As the code is a transparent log of what was done to the data, anyone else who has access to the input data can use your code and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team. This makes your results more credible.

**3. Re-usability/automation**<br>
We can copy/paste a section of code from one project to another.
Meaning that we can repeat all work on one project to another project
with just some small adjustments.

## Can correct code be both good or bad?

Think of it as: "What makes a _theory_ and/or _methods_ section in a report good or bad?" 

Can a peer with comparable knowledge about the topic at hand follow the code? 

In data science and research we use the code to communicate to team members, peer-reviewers, consumers of our outputs etc. what was done to our data. 

Think of code as both something that enables us to do advanced data work, but also as the most central tool about how we communicate about advanced data work.

# Some common concepts in programming

## Code is a file meant to run from top to bottom

.pull-left[
When writing code this is far from always true. 
We manually jump back and forth to solve bugs,
to make the code more readable etc.

But in the end, we want code that does the task correctly when executed from top to bottom

## Repeating parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to repeat a section of the code. 
For example, repeat a section 10 times, 
repeat a section once for each country in the data, 
repeat some code until you found a match in your data. 

Some of these repeats can be implemented manually,
but some cannot, for example when we

In programming these are called loops. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to skip a section of the code.
For example, in some repeats of a group skip some code,
or skip sections that does not apply in code 
meant to be used on different data.

This is particularly important when writing re-usable code.

In programming these are called if-conditions. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
In the end you have a file where anyone can see exactly what data you used,
what you did to that data,
which values you edited,
what parts you repeated and what parts you skipped,
and finally what outputs were created.

This is fully transparent and therefore much more credible data work.
Someone can also be inspired of or build on your work.
