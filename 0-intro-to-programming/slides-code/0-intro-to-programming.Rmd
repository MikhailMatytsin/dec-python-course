## What we assume about you:

Python programming can be used for many topics in computer science and we need to restrict the scope.
Therefore, we make the following assumptions about you and how you want to use Python: 

1. You want to use Python for data work (numbers, text data, geo-data etc.) 

1. Developing software, a server back-end etc.

1. You have some experience working with data. For example, extensive work in Excel or some work in Stata or R.

1. You are familiar with the topic you want to apply your Python skills to

## Scope of this session

.pull-left[
The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
that you have any background in programming. 

If you have no background in any type of programming, 
then this session will prepare you for the rest of the course.

We will cover how working with code is different,
some basic concepts of programming
as well as allow a lot of time for questions.

**Content of this session:**

1. Why programming and why Python?

1. How is the workflow different when I write code?

1. Some common concepts in programming

# Why programming? Why Python?

---
class:  middle

## Why programming? 

.pull-left[
Write instructions for a computer (code) to interact with the data,
instead of manually edit the data.

Computers are very exact.
The code we write becomes an exact record
of what was done to the data 
and how outputs were generted.

In Excel, outputs are created
using a mix of formulas and editing the data manually.
We share the final output but not exactly how we got there. 

In programming we share the final output 
**and** the code that unambigiously shows how we got there.

## Why Python?

Why are there so many programming languages? How is Python over any other language?

| Reason  | Description | Example of opposite |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Free/Open-source | Python is and will always be free | Licensed software such as Stata |
| Popular | Many users means many user developed tools | Any other language |
| Easy syntax | Python code reads more similarly to regular English | Most older languages |
| General purpose | Python can be used for data science, servers, software etc. | R is only great at data science |
| High-level | Python code runs the same way on Windows and Mac | Optimized languages such as C++ |
| Error handling | Python stops when there is an error in the code | Javascript in web browsers |

## Data work in Excel vs. programmaing

When working with code you need a different mindset and approach to datawork

.pull-left[
### Excel
* In Excel you edit the `.xlsx` file directly and save new version of the file.
* This file includes all input data, formulas, manual edits
as well the final outputs. 
* The final output can be a results of 
manual edits, formulas in cells, features from the menus in Excel 
or mix of them all
* When collaborating, you share the file 
and other team members makes edits directly to the file
* Apart from formulas in cells, 
there is no log of what anyone has done manually to the data
]

.pull-right[
### Programming
* In programming you only edit the code, 
and never directly the input data or the output
* Think of code as instructions for a computer on how to
generate outputs from a certain input, 
including all data cleaning steps.
* When collaborating, you share the code files,
and other team members only edit the instructions in the code
* The code should never require any manual steps - all steps needed should be included in the code
* Anyone with the code and the inputs should be able to genereate the same outputs, with no other action than running the code

## Programming is like writing recepies

.pull-left[
### Sponge cake:
* Set oven on 200C
* Melt 200g butter and mix with 200g sugar
* Mix in 4eggs one at the time
* Mix in 200g flour
* Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 min
]

.pull-right[
### Data science visualization:
* Get GDP per capita data from for all countries
* Get investment data from all WB client countries
* Remove data that was not found in both dataset
* Sort ascendingly on GDP per capita
* Export a scatter plot and format the colors and the text
]

Really, thinking of your code as a baking recipe is a great approach to write good code.

## The code is an output in itself

Many people new to programming only think of _code as a means to an end_.
Something that give them access to advanced topics like 
regression analysis, machine learning, national language processing etc.

While it is true that code enables you to do advanced things you should consider the **_code as a end in itself_**. Think of code as an output just as much as dashboards, data visualizations etc. are.

Think of **_code as a comprehensive and exact method to communicate_** 
about your work. 
Outputs shared, published etc. together with the code used to generate them
will always be received as more credible.

Results in a research papers without a _theory_/_methods_ section
are often no considered credible results.
Similarly, data work not accompanied with code 
is often not considered credible datawork.


---

## Re-use code

Since the instructions in programming are files 
separate from inputs and outputs, 
we can easier copy instructions across different projects. 

Even if you were to have an exact log of all steps ever done to an Excel file,
it would likely involve a lot of work applying them all to a new file,
and it would be error prone.

Programmers always re-use code across projects.
It is an art to write fully re-usable code 
that require little or no work when re-used across projects.
But it will always be easier and less error prone
than manually copy work in Excel.

Some developers write code which only purpose is 
to be used by other users in their projects.
This is often developed as open-source code packages.
Such code packages are called a "_libraries_" and
there are 1000s of them free to use.
This means that for most purposes 
you do not need to write your code starting from scratch.
You can always build on someone else's efforts.

## Correct code can still be bad code

Since the code is a central component in both
communication about and collaboration on your work 
it is important that you write good code.
Good code is more than just code that generates correct results.

As an example, have you ever received a letter written by a lawyer
that is difficult to read even though it is very correct?
Or have you ever read a World Bank working paper with
a theory section that is impossible to follow? 
We want to write code that also makes sense to someone 
that has a different skill set.

The peer most likely to benefit from your code being good code
is your future self.
Hastily written code, even when generating correct outputs, is likely to cause you or someone in your team a delay much longer then writing the code well in the first place.

## How to learn how to write good code

Learn from the beginning how to write good code. 
There are almost always more than one way to solve something in code. 

**Learn from others**. 
Whatever way we recommended in this course 
is often based on  the practice with which we think 
it is the easiest to write good code. 
This is true for most trainings and tutorials you will learn from.

**Review each other's code**. 
The best way to learn about good code and the importance of it
is to review code that has room from improvement.
When you don't understand code, 
pay attention to what is difficult to follow
and ask yourself if you do the same thing.
In addition to being a great learning experience, 
peer-review of your code is a great way for you to improve,
not just your skills,
but also the code that you are contributing to your team.

**Use comments**. Comments is a concept that 
almost all programming languages have.
Comments is a descriptive bit of text in your code file
that is skipped by the computer. 
It's only purpose is to make the code itself easier 
to follow by a human reader.

## Summary - key advantages of programming:

**1. Transparency**<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent log
of everything ever done to the input data.
This log can be shared with others,
but the person likely to benefit from this most frequently is yourself.

**2. Replication**<br>
As the code is a transparent log of what was done to the data,
anyone else who has access to the input data can use your code
and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team.
This makes your results more credible
and is becoming a standard requreirment in research.

**3. Re-usability/automation**<br>
We can copy/paste a section of code from one project to another.
Meaning that we can repeat all work on one project to another project
with just some small adjustments. 
Over time we build a toolbox of code sections for tasks we frequently need,
and we will be much more productive.

## Code is a file meant to run from top to bottom

.pull-left[
When writing code this is far from always true. 
We manually jump back and forth to solve bugs,
to make the code more readable etc.

But in the end, we want code that does the task correctly when executed from top to bottom

## Repeating parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to repeat a section of the code. 
For example, repeat a section 10 times, 
repeat a section once for each country in the data, 
repeat some code until you found a match in your data. 

Some of these repeats can be implemented manually,
but some cannot, for example when we

In programming these are called loops. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to skip a section of the code.
For example, in some repeats of a group skip some code,
or skip sections that does not apply in code 
meant to be used on different data.

This is particularly important when writing re-usable code.

In programming these are called if-conditions. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
In the end you have a file where anyone can see exactly what data you used,
what you did to that data,
which values you edited,
what parts you repeated and what parts you skipped,
and finally what outputs were created.

This is fully transparent and therefore much more credible data work.
Someone can also be inspired of or build on your work.
