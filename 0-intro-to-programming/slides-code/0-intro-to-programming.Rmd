## What we assume about you:

Python programming can be used for so many topics in computer science 
that it is impossible to cover all of them.
Therefore, we make the following assumptions about you and your use case: 

1. You want to use Python for some kind of data work (numbers, text data, geo-data etc.) as opposed to developing software, a server back-end etc.

1. You have some experience working with data. For example, extensive work in Excel or some work in Stata or R.

1. You are familiar with the topic you want to apply your Python skills on and (if applicable) the scientific/statistical methods you want to apply

## Scope of this session

.pull-left[
The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
that you have any background in programming. 

However, if you have no background in any type of programming, 
then this session is for you.

We will cover how working with code is different
than working in, for example, Excel. 
We will also cover some basic concepts of programming 
that you are expected to know in the rest of this training.

1. What is code and how do I use it?

# Why programming? Why Python?

## Why programming? 

.pull-left[
When working in programming we do not interact with the data directly.
Instead, we write code that are exact instructions on how to interact with the data.

Computers follow these instructions to generate the outputs with great exactness.
They never do anything not in the instructions.

Compare with Excel where we make edits manually directly to the data,
and share new versions of that data.

In Excel we hare the final output but not how we got there. 
In programming we share the code to remove any ambiguity 
what was done to the data.

You cannot look at an Excel file and know if any data cells were changed manually.

.pull-right[

**1. Transparency**:<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent list of anything ever done to the raw data.

<br>**2. Replication**:<br>
Anyone else who has access to the data inputs can use your code and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team.

<br>**3. Re-usability**/**automation**:<br>
We can copy/paste these instruction across our projects.

In programming we copy/paste instructions for how to do tasks all the time. 
Some programmers publish code with the sole purpose of it being used by others.

## Why Python?

Everything about programming on the previous slide applies to all programming languages. Why are we teaching Python over any other language?

1. Python is popular - especially in data science 
Since we commonly copy other people's code, this actually matter a lot

2. Python is can be used for much more than statistics/data science. Alternatives to Python like R and Stata can only be used for data

# Data work in Excel vs. programmaing

### Excel
* In Excel you edit the everything directly and save new new version of the `.xlsx` file. 
* This file includes all your input data as well as the final outputs. 
* The final output can both generated manually and by formulas in the file
* When collaborating, you share the file and any team member can edit any data in the file or add formulas that edit the data

### Programming
* In programming you only edit the code, which is the instructions on how to get from the inputs to the outputs. 
* There is no way for you to modify the input data or any of the outputs.
* When collaborating, you share the instructions and team members can only edit the instructions
* The outputs can be generated by anyone who has access to both he inputs and the instructions. 
* Manual edits to the data or the outputs are never a part of the workflow.

## Code is a file meant to run from top to bottom

.pull-left[
When writing code this is far from always true. 
We manually jump back and forth to solve bugs,
to make the code more readable etc.

But in the end, we want code that does the task correctly when executed from top to bottom

## Repeating parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to repeat a section of the code. 
For example, repeat a section 10 times, 
repeat a section once for each country in the data, 
repeat some code until you found a match in your data. 

Some of these repeats can be implemented manually,
but some cannot, for example when we

In programming these are called loops. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to skip a section of the code.
For example, in some repeats of a group skip some code,
or skip sections that does not apply in code 
meant to be used on different data.

This is particularly important when writing re-usable code.

In programming these are called if-conditions. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
In the end you have a file where anyone can see exactly what data you used,
what you did to that data,
which values you edited,
what parts you repeated and what parts you skipped,
and finally what outputs were created.

This is fully transparent and therefore much more credible data work.
Someone can also be inspired of or build on your work.
