# Scope

.pull-left[
The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
that you have any background in programming. 

However, if you have no background in any type of programming, 
then this session is for you.

We will cover how working with code is different
than working in, for example, Excel. 
We will also cover some basic concepts of programming 
that you are expected to know in the rest of this training.

**Content of this session:**

1. Why programming and why Python?

1. What is code and how do I use it?

1. Some basic concepts of programming

# Why programming? 

.pull-left[
When working in programming we do not interact with the data directly.
Instead, we write code that are exact instructions on how to interact with the data.

Computers follow these instructions to generate the outputs with great exactness.
They never do anything not in the instructions.

Compare with Excel where we make edits manually directly to the data,
and share new versions of that data.

In Excel we hare the final output but not how we got there. 
In programming we share the code to remove any ambiguity 
what was done to the data.

You cannot look at an Excel file and know if any data cells were changed manually.

**1. Transparency**:<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent list of anything ever done to the raw data.

<br>**2. Replication**:<br>
Anyone else who has access to the data inputs can use your code and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team.

<br>**3. Re-usability**/**automation**:<br>
We can copy/paste these instruction across our projects.

In programming we copy/paste instructions for how to do tasks all the time. 
Some programmers publish code with the sole purpose of it being used by others.

# Why Python?

Everything about programming on the previous slide applies to all programming languages. Why are we teaching Python over any other language?

1. Python is popular - especially in data science 
Since we commonly copy other people's code, this actaully matter a lot

2. Python is can be used for much more than statistics/data science. Alternatives to Python like R and Stata can only be used for data
