## What we assume about you:

Python programming can be used for many topics in computer science.
It is impossible to cover all of them in one training.
Therefore, we make the following assumptions about you and your use case: 

1. You want to use Python for some kind of data work (numbers, text data, geo-data etc.) as opposed to developing software, a server back-end etc.

1. You have some experience working with data. For example, extensive work in Excel or some work in Stata or R.

1. You are familiar with the topic you want to apply your Python skills on and (if applicable) the scientific/statistical methods you want to apply

## Scope of this session

.pull-left[
The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
that you have any background in programming. 

If you have no background in any type of programming, 
then this session will prepare you for the rest of the course.

We will cover how working with code is different,
some basic concepts of programming
as well as allow a lot of time for questions.

**Content of this session:**

1. Why programming and why Python?

1. How is the workflow different when I write code?

# Why programming? Why Python?

## Why programming? 

.pull-left[
When working in programming we do not interact with the data directly.
Instead, we write code that are exact instructions for a computer to interact with the data.

Computers always follows our instructions exactly.
This give us an exact and transparent record 
of what was done to our data 
to generate the outputs that we publish.

Compare with Excel where outputs are created
using a mix of formulas and editing the data manually.

In Excel we share the final output but not how we got there. 
In programming we share the final output 
and we can include unambiguous instructions how to got there.

## Why programming? 

This can be summed up in these key advantages about programming:

**1. Transparency**<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent log
of everything ever done to the input data.
This log can be shared with others,
but the person likely to benefit from this most frequently is yourself.

**2. Replication**<br>
As the code is a transparent log of what was done to the data, anyone else who has access to the input data can use your code and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team. This makes your results more credible.

**3. Re-usability/automation**<br>
We can copy/paste a section of code from one project to another.
Meaning that we can repeat all work on one project to another project
with just some small adjustments. 
In fact, some developers write code which only purpose is 
to be used by other users in their projects. 
Such code is called a "_library_" and there are 1000s of them free to use.

## Why Python?

Everything about programming on the previous slide applies to all programming languages. Why are we teaching Python over any other language?

1. Python is popular - especially in data science 
Since we commonly copy other people's code, this actually matter a lot

2. Python is can be used for much more than statistics/data science. Alternatives to Python like R and Stata can only be used for data

## Data work in Excel vs. programmaing

When working with code you need a different mindset and approach to datawork

.pull-left[
### Excel
* In Excel you edit the everything directly and save new new version of the `.xlsx` file. 
* This file includes all your input data as well as the final outputs. 
* The final output can both generated manually and by formulas in the file
* When collaborating, you share the file and any team member can edit any data in the file or add formulas that edit the data
]

.pull-right[
### Programming
* In programming you only edit the code, which is the instructions on how to get from the inputs to the outputs. 
* There is no way for you to modify the input data or any of the outputs.
* When collaborating, you share the instructions and team members can only edit the instructions
* The outputs can be generated by anyone who has access to both he inputs and the instructions. 
* Manual edits to the data or the outputs are never a part of the workflow.

## The code is an output

People coming to programming from Excel in order to be able to do advanced things like machine learning, regression analysis, national language processing etc., sees the code as a means to an end. We strongly disagree.

The code should be treated as much as an output as the output of the code. Outputs accompanied with code is always much more credible.

This is especially important for everyone working on research. 
Just like journals have required, for a long time, that all papers have a _theory_ and/or _methods_ section to explain the statistical method, more and more journals require that all papers include the code to show exactly how the code was processed and how the statistical methods were applied to the data.

## Programming is like writing recepies

.pull-left[
### Sponge cake:
* Set oven on 200C
* Melt 200g butter and mix with 200g sugar
* Mix in 4eggs one at the time
* Mix in 200g flour
* Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 min
]

.pull-right[
### Data science visualization:
* Get GDP per capita data from for all countries
* Get investment data from all WB client countries
* Remove data that was not found in both dataset
* Sort ascendingly on GDP per capita
* Export a scatter plot and format the colors and the text
]

Really, thinking of your code as a baking recipe is a great approach to write good code.

## Can correct code be both good or bad?

Think of it as: "What makes a _theory_ and/or _methods_ section in a report good or bad?" 

Can a peer with comparable knowledge about the topic at hand follow the code? 

In data science and research we use the code to communicate to team members, peer-reviewers, consumers of our outputs etc. what was done to our data. 

Think of code as both something that enables us to do advanced data work, but also as the most central tool about how we communicate about advanced data work.

# Some common concepts in programming

## Code is a file meant to run from top to bottom

.pull-left[
When writing code this is far from always true. 
We manually jump back and forth to solve bugs,
to make the code more readable etc.

But in the end, we want code that does the task correctly when executed from top to bottom

## Repeating parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to repeat a section of the code. 
For example, repeat a section 10 times, 
repeat a section once for each country in the data, 
repeat some code until you found a match in your data. 

Some of these repeats can be implemented manually,
but some cannot, for example when we

In programming these are called loops. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
Sometimes we need to skip a section of the code.
For example, in some repeats of a group skip some code,
or skip sections that does not apply in code 
meant to be used on different data.

This is particularly important when writing re-usable code.

In programming these are called if-conditions. 
We will cover how to do them in Python in session 2.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[
In the end you have a file where anyone can see exactly what data you used,
what you did to that data,
which values you edited,
what parts you repeated and what parts you skipped,
and finally what outputs were created.

This is fully transparent and therefore much more credible data work.
Someone can also be inspired of or build on your work.
