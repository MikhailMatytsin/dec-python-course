## Scope of this session

.pull-left[
  The *DEC Foundations of Python* does not require
  that you have any background in programming. 
  
  If you have no programming background, 
  then this session will prepare you for the rest of the course.
  
  In addition to learning how to write code,
  you also need to learn to approach data work slightly differently.
]

.pull-right[
  **Content of this session:**
  
  1. Why programming? Work flow in data work programming
  
  1. Why Python?
  
  1. How does one write good code?
  
  1. Some common concepts in programming

## What we assume about you:

Python can be used for many topics in computer science. 
But we must restrict the scope.
We've made these assumptions about you and why you want to learn Python: 

1. You want to use Python for data work (numbers, text data, geo-data etc.), 
as opposed to, developing software, website back-ends etc.

1. You have some experience working with data. 
For example, extensive work in Excel or some work in Stata or R.

# Work flow in data work programming

class:  middle

## Why programming? 

.pull-left[

  Data work should be very exact. Computers are more exact than humans.

  Instead of manually working with the data directly, 
  we write code that are instructions for computers to work with the data.
  
  Since computers are very exact, 
  our code becomes an exact record of what was done to the data 
  and how outputs were generated.

## Compare Excel and programming

  | | Excel | Programming |
  |---------|-----|-----|
  | Are manual edits done directly to the files containing data? | Yes, we manually work directly in the file containing the raw data and and outputs | We only manually edit the code which is a different file from data and output.  |
  | Can we write instructions for the computer to modify our data? | Yes, formulas | Yes, code |
  | Are instructions to modify our data mixed with manual edits? | Yes, it is common | No, that's never the work flow |
  | Do we have an unambiguous way of sharing what was done to the data? | Only formulas are shown, not manual edits | Yes, it is the code |
  | Is it easy for a reviewer to reproduce all steps? | Its challenging or impossible to follow any manual edits as there is no record of them | Yes, anyone who has the code and the access to the input data can reproduce everything |

  ### Sponge cake:
  * Set oven on 200C
  * Melt 200g butter and mix with 200g sugar
  * Mix in 4eggs one at the time
  * Mix in 200g flour
  * Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 min

  ### Data science visualization:
  * Get GDP per capita data from for all countries
  * Get investment data from all WB client countries
  * Remove data that was not found in both dataset
  * Sort ascendingly on GDP per capita
  * Export a scatter plot and format the colors and the text

## Data work in programmaing

.pull-left[

* Code should only have well-documented inputs 

* How to document original data:
    * _Primary data_: secure back-up of raw data
    * _Secondary data_: Cite the data source

* Derivatives of original data (new data products and analysis outputs) should be created from original data and code only
  
* Version control your code - Git/GitHub

## Code is how you communcate data science

.pull-left[
  Chefs use recipes to communicate about food, 
  data scientists use code to communicate about data work.
  
  A cook book of poorly written recipes will lead to bad food. 
  The same applies to code and data outputs.

class: 

## Why Python?


.pull-left[

Why are there so many programming languages? How does Python compare to other languages?

**Free/Open-source**: Python is and will always be 100% free to use

**Easy syntax**: Python code reads more similarly to regular English

**Widely used**: Many users means many user developed tools

**#1 in data science**: The language with most data science tools

**General purpose**: Python can be used for data science, servers, software etc.

.pull-left[
  **Correct code:** Code that generates correct results
  
  **Good code:** Code that can be understood and used by others
]

.pull-right[
  **Code should be both correct code and good code.**
  
  Code is only really valuable to a team,
  if it both generates the correct results 
  and can understood by the team members.

## Errors and bugs

.pull-left[
* Errors is a part of programming and they should be your friend
  
* Python always give you some message when there is an error
  
* Learn how to interpret error messages - google them

* You will have thousands of bugs - 
test run your code and find out where it breaks

## Re-use code

Since the instructions (code) is separate from input and output,
we can re-use code blocks within and across projects. An imporant paradigm in coding is **DRY** (don't uepeat yourself)

Three levels of re-using code:

* **Copy-paste:** Copy a block a code of modify it to fit the context

* **Functions:** A block of code you written that can be referenced across the project

* **Library:** Code packages developed by others to solve difficult tasks but made easy use in any project

In short, in programming you should always build on someone else' efforts. This _someone_ can be your past self.

Compare with Excel. You can use the built-in features, but how do you build on the efforts of other users?

## When the code works you are only half-done

Once you have written correct code, 
you should make sure that you write correct **and** good code.

How to make correct code into good code?

* Simplify
* Document
* Peer-review

Ask yourself, would someone with basic knowledge in your topic
and basic knowledge be able to follow you code?

The person most likely to suffer from your code being hard to follow
is the future you. It is unlikely that you save time in the long run by settling code that is "_just_" correct.

## Comments

All programming languages has a feature called _comments_. 
Comments is text inside the code that is skipped when the computer executes the code.
Its only purpose is to provide context to the code for a human reading the code.

Good comments explain the _why_ and not the _what_. What the code does can often be inferred from the code itself. Comments best compliment the code if it explains why the code is written a certain way.

## Learn how to write good code from others

#### Use critical thinking when reading code examples
When you read code examples, always ask yourself if it was easy to follow. Why was it easy to follow or why was it not easy to follow?

#### Peer-review code
Code examples are usually well curated elegant and simple ways of solving some coding tasks. 
This might not be applicable for your day-to-day tasks.

Reviewing code written by someone who are at your level of Python skills
and who work on similar types of projects might be the best way 
on how to realize what makes your own code hard to follow,

## Version control of code means version control of all your data work

.pull-left[

The code is used to generate all derivatives of the original data (intermediate data, final data, results, data visualizations, dashboards etc.)

If the original data used as input is fixed (backed-up or properly cited) and the code is version controlled, then all version of the derivatives are also version controlled.

Since this is such a valuable feature of programming, much work has gone into develop standard for version control of code. That standard is a software called Git/GitHub.

## Code instructions are executed top to bottom

.pull-left[
Just like a recipe, the instructions in code are read from top to bottom.

However, when re-using code to not repeat ourselves, 
we sometimes needs to repeat some parts of the code, 
and sometimes skip some blocks of code.

Session 2 will cover how to implement these concepts in Python.
In this session we will only spend time to make sure that the concept makes sense on a high level.

## Repeating parts of the code

.pull-left[
We can repeat a section of code using **loops**.

Three ways of deciding how many times to repeat:
* **Hard coded**. Repeat an exact number of tiems. For example, 10 times
* **While-loop**. Repeat until a condition is met. For example, a match is found
* **Dynamically**. Use a characteristc in the data to decide the number of repeats. For example, repeat once for each country in the data set.

## Sometimes skipping parts of the code

.pull-left[

Some code blocks might have sections that does not always apply. 
We need to instruct the computer when to skip that code. 
We do this using **if-conditions**.

Examples:
* When repeating several blocks of code in a loop, only execute certain blocks on certain countries.
* When writing code meant to be re-used across different contexts, if-conditions can make the code adapt to different contexts without manual edits.

## Summary - key advantages of programming:

**1. Transparency**<br>
You can share your code as a fully transparent log
of everything ever done to the input data.
This log can be shared with others,
but the person likely to benefit from this most frequently is yourself.

**2. Replication**<br>
As the code is a transparent log of what was done to the data,
anyone else who has access to the input data can use your code
and run it to verify that they get the same results as you and your team.
This makes your results more credible
and is becoming a standard requirement in research.

**3. Re-usability/automation**<br>
We can copy/paste a section of code from one project to another.
Meaning that we can repeat all work on one project to another project
with just some small adjustments. 
Over time we build a toolbox of code sections for tasks we frequently need,
and we will be much more productive.
