    "#### The Containers of Atoms of Python\n",

    "These atoms and containers are combined into something called objects. **We can think of these objects as molecules**. \n",

    "Object can be simple or very complex. But no matter how complex something you ever encounter in Python is, it can always be traced back to a combination of the atoms and their containers.\n",

    "If you load some data into a dataset in Python, it will be stored in an object. While you do not need to understand the chemical make-up an object to use with it, it will expect that you to provide inputs using atoms and containers when you want to modify it, analyze the data in it etc.\n",
