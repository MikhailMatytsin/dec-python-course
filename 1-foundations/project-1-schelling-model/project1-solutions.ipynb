    "Congratulations if you made until this point! we hoped you enjoyed this programming project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focused on the coding aspect of programming, but there were also two important elements that we outlined for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The project was divided into tasks that we planned carefully\n",
    "2. We included function helpers (the texts describing functions and explaining the input and outputs) so you could have a better idea of the solutions you needed to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-life programming problems, you not only will have to code but to implement (1) and (2) as well. Planning a solution for a problem and writing code documentation are crucial aspects of programming that will make the coding part easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a simple implementation of Schelling's model of segregation. If you want to take the challenge of making it more efficient or complex, you can start by introducing the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- In task 4 we're evaluating all the available locations for each agent. This is good to keep things clearer in a first approach, but it's slowing the model down. A better implementation would be to keep a list of available locations that is constantly updated with the moves of each agent\n",
    "- If more than one location is available for an agent to move and they need to decide using Euclidean distance, it's natural that the closest location will be around the current location of the agent. Then, the search of the location could start by locations that are within one horizontal or vertical square of distance, continue with the diagonals, then with those spaces at two squares of distance and so on. This approach would guarantee that the first available spot is the closest one\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the neighborhood extension (which we set equal to 1) another parameter of the model, just as the number of rounds or similarity threshold\n",
    "- Make the similarity threshold a random parameter that is different for each household and is normally or uniformly distributed\n",
    "- Assign to each agent an initial budget allocation and make the moves have a cost. Agents can't move anymore when their budget is lower than the move cost. You can also make the budgets of each agent different by group and see how this changes the final city grid distribution\n",
    "- Change the moving rule:\n",
    "    - Agents move to a random empty location\n",
    "    - Agents prefer a location that is more \"vibrant\" and has neighborhood with more agents"
