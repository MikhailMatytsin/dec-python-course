Agent-based models are representations of systems where the behavior of independent entities (agents) is simulated in order to understand how aggregated outcomes in the system are produced. In this project, you will implement a simplified version of the model in Python using only custom functions and basic data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a participant of this course, the learning objective for you in this assignment is to **see how the basic variable types of Python are used to build relatively complex object**. Think of the analogy we introduced in session one about the atoms and the more complex forms of life that they make. You'll see this in action in this project. Furthermore, think of this project not only as a test of what you've learned up to this point, but more importantly as an applied task that will show you other aspects and featurs of Python programming that we have not covered in the lecture sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided in tasks that should be solved in order and build upon each other until a final function that runs an entire simulation of the model is developed. To help making sure that each task is solved correctly before moving on to the next one, we have prepared testing functions that your solution must pass before a task is completed.\n",

    "### Further tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a simple implementation of Schelling's model of segregation. If you want to take the challenge of making it more efficient or complex, you can start by introducing the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- In task 4 we're evaluating all the available locations for each agent. This is good to keep things clearer in a first approach, but it's slowing the model down. A better implementation would be to keep a list of available locations that is constantly updated with the moves of each agent\n",
    "- If more than one location is available for an agent to move and they need to decide using Euclidean distance, it's natural that the closest location will be around the current location of the agent. Then, the search of the location could start by locations that are within one horizontal or vertical square of distance, continue with the diagonals, then with those spaces at two squares of distance and so on. This approach would guarantee that the first available spot is the closest one\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the neighborhood extension (which we set equal to 1) another parameter of the model, just as the number of rounds or similarity threshold\n",
    "- Make the similarity threshold a random parameter that is different for each household and is normally or uniformly distributed\n",
    "- Assign to each agent an initial budget allocation and make the moves have a cost. Agents can't move anymore when their budget is lower than the move cost. You can also make the budgets of each agent different by group and see how this changes the final city grid distribution\n",
    "- Change the moving rule:\n",
    "    - Agents move to a random empty location\n",
    "    - Agents prefer a location that is more \"vibrant\" and has neighborhood with more agents"
