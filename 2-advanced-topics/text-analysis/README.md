# Introduction to text analysis

Text analysis is the process of extracting meaningful information from text data, enabling programmers to uncover patterns and insights that would otherwise remain buried under text corpora. This hands-on session introduces the fundamentals of text analysis using popular Python text analysis libraries. Participants will learn essential techniques such as text data preprocessing, word and n-gram frequency analysis, and basic text classification, applied in examples for development research. The session will provide foundational skills to participants so they can pursue further specialization in text analysis and natural language processing independently. This session assumes basic proficiency in Python and familiarity with the Pandas library, though no installation of software is required.
